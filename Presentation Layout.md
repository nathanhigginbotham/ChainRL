# Presentations

## Intro:

- Set the scene
- Tell them what we've learnt, what we've done and what we plan to do


### Talk about How RL works?
- States, actions.

### A little about the supply chain?
- A problem that underlies the entire economic world pretty much.


### What we used (ORGYM and SB3)?
- Orgym gives us environments, SB3 gives us agents.


## How we started to do what we have done
- Explored our own algorithms independently 
- Started simple
- Getting more complex now

### Testing on InvManagement
- PPO to get started

### Mass testing on InvManage
- Big plot

### Tested NetManagement, got more complex
- With general success


### We've also done other stuff abit!
- Tuning
- Implementing Vectorisation 
- Slowly exploring network infrastructure

## What we are going to do now and Wrap Up 

- More complex Networks, more realism, different demands etc.

## Conclusion (briefly what we've done and why, what we're going to do and our goals)

- So we've figured out the basics, we're at the precipice of discovery now.
